  <a>For many years, a Danish museum argued that its ancient head of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus belonged to a
    bronze torso at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

  <a>sort of discovery is rare in the world of Greco-Roman statuary, where headless torsos and torso-less heads are,
    though ubiquitous, seldom reconnected. But the museum, the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, went so far as to arrange a loan
    so it could exhibit the head and body together in 1979 and even tried to buy the torso, without success.</a>
